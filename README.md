# Facial keypoint detection

## Summary
The toppic of this project is Kaggle competition: Facial Keypoints Detection

The idea is to create an algorithm that predicts the locations of keypoints in unlabeled images.
Performance is evaluated on the Kaggle test dataset, where keypoint locations are not publicly available. Predicted keypoints are sent as a CSV file and scored based on root mean square error.
The solution will also be tested on a self-created set of images to visually verify that it can accurately locate keypoints.
